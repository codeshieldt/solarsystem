            About 1,000,000,000 years ago, Earth had its first signs of life. Single-celled organisms consumed the sun's energy. 
            As a waste product, these cyanobacteria eventually filled the oceans and atmosphere with oxygen.
            Next, an oxygenated atmosphere paved the way for more complex life forms to exist. 
            At about 100,000,000 years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth until their abrupt extinction.
            Finally, 10,000,000 years ago was the age of mammals. And these mammals are our direct ancestors. 
            It was only 100,000 years ago when homo sapiens truly evolved. <br><br>
            In this Earth timeline, we lay out all the pieces on the floor. 
            What sequence of events has unfolded for Earth to support life and for it to evolve?

            There are more planets than stars in our galaxy. The current count orbiting our star: eight.
            The inner, rocky planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. NASA's newest rover — Perseverance — landed on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021. 
            The outer planets are gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.
            Beyond Neptune, a newer class of smaller worlds called dwarf planets reign, including longtime favorite Pluto. 
            Thousands more planets have been discovered beyond our solar system. Scientists call them exoplanets (exo means "from outside").
